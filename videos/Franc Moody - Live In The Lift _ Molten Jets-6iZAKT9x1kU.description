People! We miss playing for you SO MUCH. The next best thing we could do is create a special show with sublime Directors, Molten Jets/Intergalactic. The Franc Moody Live experience... in a lift! We're using the occasion to raise money for the Music Venue Trustâ€™s #saveourvenues campaign. Please watch the video and show appreciation by donating to this great cause! It's worth it! ðŸš€ðŸš€

We also have a Limited Edition 'Live in the Lift' Tee and Merch line, available until Monday only. All proceeds will also go to support the #saveourvenues campaign by the Music Venue Trust.
